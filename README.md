# Dunsany

> A procedural pantheon generator.

Generate a list of deities with archetypes, powers, characteristics, and relationships.

## Deities

Deities each have a single archetype (god of war, goddess of storms, etc). This archetype helps define their backstory, a short snippet designed to open up stories of these deities' mighty feats.

Like the gods of old, these deities are gendered, being one of four: male, female, hermaphrodite, and none. This will affect their relationships with other gods and goddesses of the pantheon.

Each deity starts with a pre-defined list of relationships which will likely connect all deities in a smaller pantheon and most in a larger one.

Those relationships will ebb and flow, reaching points of deep love and other times deep hatred. These are indicated by the `eris`, `eros`, `philo`, and `agape` indicators on the relationship edge.

## Todo

- [ ] Add weights to genders (less nones and fewer hermaphrodites)
- [ ] Add backstory generation
- [ ] Add better linguistic rules to name generation
- [ ] Add more characteristics that weight a deity's personality, effectiveness, and worship
